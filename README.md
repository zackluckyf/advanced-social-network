## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples:
Node, npm, angular cli -g, etc.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Before pushing always run `npm run all-tests` and fix everything before pushing to not break the build

## Angular cli

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run hmr` for a dev server with hot module replacement.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Test Environment

Run `npm run prod` to build the project and launch the server. 

## Running The Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

Run `ng lint` to lint the code.
